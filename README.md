# Countries Database

`Countries Database` provides a list with the big majority of countries abbreviation with their nationalities, coordinates (latitutes and longitutes), and names.

## SQL

You'll find a SQL file with `INSERT` statements and `TABLE` structure.
Feel free to change the table structure, but do not forget to change the column names in the `INSERT` statements.

## HTML

There's also a simple HTML table written with Markdown you can use.

## Missing Countries

If you did not find a country, please let me know (submit an issue, for example) and we can keep it up to date.
